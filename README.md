A group project for COMP0258: Open-Endedness and General Intelligence, a course at UCL led by Professor Tim Rockt√§schel.

"Open-endedness (OE) is the ability of a system to keep generating interesting artifacts forever, which is one of the defining features of natural evolution [Stanley et al., 2017]."

## How To Run Different Parts of Code

In order to run jupyter notebooks it is as simple as doing the following commands:
```sh
poetry install
poetry run jupyter notebook
```

Although if you wanted to make this a global setting and use this vitrual environment for everything I would do the following:
```sh
poetry run ipython kernel install --user --name=<KERNEL_NAME>
jupyter notebook
```
This will make the default python for running your notebooks on the jupyter platform the virtual environment's python.

### Running Python Scripts

To run different python scripts one would do:
```sh
poetry run python3 SCRIPT.py
```

## Environment set up

```sh
conda create -n asal python=3.10 -y && \
conda activate asal && \
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=11.8 -c pytorch -c nvidia -y && \
conda install numpy imageio -c conda-forge -y && \
pip install evotorch && \
pip3.11 install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers@v4.49.0-Gemma-3
```
